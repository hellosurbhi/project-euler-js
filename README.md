# project-euler-js

These are the JavaScript solutions to the Project Euler questions available on https://projecteuler.net/

The intent with this is not to simply provide answers but share the challenges I faced when attempting these problems. Every file contains detailed comments on what methods I attempted and why they did/didn't work.

I decided to solve the first 50 Project Euler archived questions in each programming language I am hoping to get mastery in.

Note: It's against the rules to share the code for Project Euler challanges past #100 so make sure you're only adding solutions to the allowed problems in your repo.

I've also made the code more intuitive by adding unit tests for all solutions. 

A good benchmark to set for yourself would be to aim to solve these in less than 30 minutes without the aid of the internet (including this repo) as much as possible.

Good luck!
